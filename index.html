            <p id="me">My name is Brock Cowen. I graduated from Cameron University in 2014 and have lived in Austin ever since. I am 29 years old now and run the QA for an ipad based Point of Sale company in Austin called UNION. In QA I do both black and white box testing on our multiple products that make up UNION, including our web browser run portal, iOS based app that runs the POS and all of our different hardware ranging from printers and cash drawers to Ingenico card swipers. I also test our mobile payments app that integrates with our point of sale. I have created test plans for all of our products and utilize tools such as Charles and MITM Proxy, New Relic, Paper Trail, GitHub and Jira to track and diagnose issues that I am experiencing. I also, often, query the database and read through the couchbase documents to do my testing.
                <br/><br/>In my spare time I like to go to movies and play disc golf. I also enjoy traveling and take any chance I get to go somewhere new.
                I am trying to get into the field of full stack web development because I would like to make the transition into more of the development side of things. With having worked at a startup 
                for the last 5 years I have quite a bit of experience in the tech industry and a solid understanding of the development cycle.
                <br/><br/>I got married this last August to my girlfriend of five years. We live in a house on the north side of Austin
                with our 2 dogs, Moose and Boulder. They are a handful but are a lot of fun. We like to take them camping every chance we get and will often times bring them to Yard Bar where we meet up with our friends for a drink and let the dogs play there.
